# eleventy-from-scratch

With this repository I set out to learn [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) following the guidance of [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_) and his course [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com).

There are approximately 30 lessons, to which I dedicate individual branches.

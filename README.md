[Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) teaches [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) with the course [Learn Eleventy From Scratch](https://learneleventyfromscratch.com).

This repository builds toward [the final website](https://issue33.com/) following the course lesson by lesson, branch by branch.

## Lesson 1: Intro

[Download the starter files](https://piccalilli.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eleventy-from-scratch/eleventy-from-scratch-starter-files.zip) and extract the `src` folder in the local directory.

Add a `.gitignore` file to remove a series of files and folders from the git control.
